# Road_accidents-resulting-in-casualty
 The project is about the data analysis on road trafic accidents resulting in a casualty. The UK government publishes data on this topic under the title “stats19”, this is the main data source.
 
 Following three problem statements have been considered for the data analysis on road accidents resulting in casualty
1. To analyze what time of day and day of the week, most number of serious accidents happened in year 2020.
2. To compare the Hospital Episode Statistics(HES) casualty data with STATS19 casualty data by road user type for England in year 2020
3. To understand which vehicle model type has most number of casualties in year 2020.

The main aim of the project is to perform data analysis on the road accidents in the UK and find out in which areas the government and residents of UK can improve to avoid the most number of accidents in UK.

### Implementation:

1. Downloaded the datasets by using stats19 R library from website https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/road-accidents-and-safety-statistics. which was published by the UK government.
2. Developed R code in Rstudio including the **HTML presentation** based on the Rmd source file.
3. Developed the code using R libraries tidyverse, lubridate, stats19, here.
4. Visualized the different types of data by using Bar and pie graphs. Few of them are attached below.

### Instructions to Run

1. Download the attached .rmd file into your local machine.
2. Also download and install the RStudio software into the system if it is not already installed on the system.
3. Open the .rmd file in RStudio and click on the run all chunks on the top right corner in the editor of RStudio which is represented by a symbol down arrow.
4. Then you can see all the code chunks are being executed by showing the different outputs of visualized graphs.
